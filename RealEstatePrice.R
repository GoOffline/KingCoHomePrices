#This is the best model we have. If we were to include sqft_living, we would have had multi-collinearity with sqft_above, and sqft_lot. To still capture the necessary information, we dropped sqft_living, 
# and include sqft_above (capture the space the home actually takes up), Has_basement to capture extra lot space not being used by the house. We included sqft_living15 and sqft_lot15 since those are the measurements of k-15 nearest neighbors. We were not provided with basement (but thats ok since its included in the sqft_living15 metric)

# Many of the features make sense in that intuition says they should be positively correlated with price, and they are. The main examples of these would be
# the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, if the house is a waterfront property, if the house is renovated, and the square footage of the living space. 
# There are some examples of features that don't make a lot of sense, and those are the ones that might require a bit of interpretation. The obvious ones
# in this case are the year built and square footage of the lot. Intuitively, one would think that a newer house is more expensive, but the fact that we see a
# negative correlation tells us that newer houses actually have a lower price. One interpretation of this is that newer houses may tend to get smaller as
# the density of housing increases, thus decreasing the price of the property, but making it more expensive per square foot. A possible interpretation 
# of the negative correlation with the square footage and the price could be along the same lines. Houses over time might have been built on smaller and smaller lots
# in order to make more units that sell for a lower price. Additionally, with newer technology and builting materials, houses may have more stories, enabling 
# the same living square footage on a smaller lot. 
# sqft_lot15 has a negative coefficient, which seems like an anomaly. However, a possible explanation is the lot may not really matter for a townhome or condo. 
# Also, in some places, some people may not like a lot that is far too big. These can influence the price, which then influence the results.
